/*
We want to be able to add the .active class to any button and make it red. This won�t work here because our button has it�s background-color set with an ID selector, which has a higher selector specificity. The rule goes like this:

ID (#id) > Class (.class) > Type (e.g. header)

Specifity also stacks so a#button.active ranks higher than a#button. Using selectors with high specificity will cause you to constantly trump old selectors with even higher ones and eventually result in !important.
